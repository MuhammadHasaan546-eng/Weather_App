# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) (or [oxc](https://oxc.rs) when used in [rolldown-vite](https://vite.dev/guide/rolldown)) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled on this template because of its impact on dev & build performances. To add it, see [this documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation).

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.

#Responsive Weather App – React + Tailwind CSS
I developed a Responsive Weather App using React and Tailwind CSS that allows users to view real-time weather updates for any city in the world. The app interacts with a weather API to display essential weather details such as temperature, condition, humidity, and wind speed.

🌍 Real-time Weather Data using API

⚛️ Built with React (Component-Based Structure)

🎨 Styled with Tailwind CSS for a clean and modern UI

📱 Fully Responsive — works smoothly on mobile, tablet, and desktop

🔎 Search Function to get weather of any city

☁️ Dynamic Weather Icons based on API response

⚡ Fast performance & smooth user experience

🛠 Tech Stack:
React, Tailwind CSS, Weather API, JavaScript (ES6+)

This project helped me strengthen my skills in React hooks, API integration, state management, and responsive design using Tailwind CSS.
